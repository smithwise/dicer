# dicer
Simple Dice Rolling to practice python, and for import into other DND related repos

nothing novel here, just needing the practice.

d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100

should be able to call dice as necessary, be it individuals, multiples, or even mixed types.

clearly import random is necessary.
